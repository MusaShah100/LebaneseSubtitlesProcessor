00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:41,812
Who is Lama?

14
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:43,939
Lama, are you pregnant?

Yes.

16
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,149
How pregnant are you?

00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,609
Seven months.

18
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:51,321
OK, <i> Caritas </ i> is going to see you.

00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:54,116
Who is Tigest Ailo?

20

The Ethiopian, Tigest Ailo?

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,537
Is it you Tigest?

22
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,340
The hearing is open.

23
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,135
Zain Al Hajj.

24
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:44,804
Remove the handcuffs.
Come closer.

25
00:05:46,056 --> 00:05:47,390
Souad and Selim Al Hajj.

26
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:48,558
Yes.

27
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,104
The complainant is in detention.

28
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,315
He is present and without handcuffs.

29
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:56,191
Show me your hands.

30
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:00,987
Also presents ...

31
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,115
His lawyer Nadine Al Aalam.

32
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,451
Accused are also present

33
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:08,828
Selim and Souad Al Hajj,

34
00:06:08,995 --> 00:06:12,332
represented by their lawyer Saiid Tamer.

35
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,254
Do you know why
Are you here, Souad?

36
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,632
Yes, I know why, your Honor.

37
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,050
Why ?

38
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,637
I know my son
to serve his sentence in prison,

39
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,931
but why does he drag us here
Again, I do not know.

40
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:30,183
We are mops,
anyone can attack us!

41
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,270
You were called as a witness
at Zain's previous trial, is that?

42
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,271
Yes.

43
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,564
And you had testified?

44
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,815
Yes.

45
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:38,984
And now you are accused.

46
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,653
Do you know why
Zain was charged?

47
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,950
Zain got into a dirty story
Because of his childishness.

48
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:51,162
Childish? He was sentenced
   5 years in prison!

49
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:52,872
Childish?

50
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:54,499
Short...

51
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:57,168
How old are you Zain?

52
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,629
I do not know,
ask them the question.

53
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,591
Your Honor, Zain was not
declared at birth,

54
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:07,512
and he has never been registered
   the civil status.

55
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,182
And since obviously his parents
do not know

56
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,852
his exact date of birth ...

57
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,730
Here is the report of the lymphatic doctor

58
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:20,317
which certifies that
Zain was about 12 years old

59
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,611
at the time of the incident.

60
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:25,030
So he is almost 12 years old?

61
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,448
Absolutely.

62
00:07:27,032 --> 00:07:28,700
Where do you live Zain?

63
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,827
Roumieh prison for minors.

64
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:34,581
You were arrested on June 15
and you have been serving your sentence since.

65
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,124
Do you know why ?

66
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:39,919
Because I planted
a dog's son with a knife.

67
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:42,130
Did you stab someone?

68
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:43,423
Yes, and it's a dog's son.

69
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,466
Oh?

70
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,217
You insist ?

71
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,220
Forbidden to laugh in the room!

72
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,723
What's all this eddy
What did you provoke?

73
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,101
On the TV and in the media.
Your prison call.

74
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,686
Do you know why you're here?

75
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,604
Yes.

76
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,272
Why ?

77
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,192
I want to complain
against my parents.

78
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,654
Why do you want to complain
against your parents?

79
00:08:07,656 --> 00:08:09,783
For giving me birth.

80
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,168
Hello.

81
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:22,379
I would like two boxes of Tramadol.

82
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,255
You need a prescription.

83
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,347
Who is it for ?

84
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:33,264
My mother.

85
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,808
Why she did not come
herself?

86
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:36,893
She had surgery on her belly.

87
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:44,734
She broke her back.

88
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,653
This is his doctor
who prescribed him?

89
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,445
Yes.

90
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:49,656
Why it's not your father
who came ?

91
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:51,032
He is paralyzed.

92
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,735
- You come to see who, Madam?
- My son.

93
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,904
- His name ?
- Ibrahim Al Hajj.

94
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,989
- Ibrahim Al Hajj?
- Yes.

95
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:18,536
Aunt Souad?
This way !

96
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:23,291
Massoud? It's you ?
How are you ?

97
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,710
How are you, my dear?

98
00:10:26,294 --> 00:10:28,797
My son Ibrahim is with you?

99
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,174
No, they took him away
in another cell.

100
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:33,426
She's trying to talk to you!

101
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,804
Tell him "bye".

102
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,931
Say bye to your cousin.

103
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,267
Your brothers are all with you
in cell?

104
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,268
Yes, everyone.

105
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:43,978
May God protect you.

106
00:10:57,283 --> 00:11:00,829
We increased the price   $ 15 a mouthful.

107
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:04,415
Our hands are busted
   force to soak and wring.

108
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:09,254
Our "sock juice" is worth more
only a kilo of meat!

109
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:11,339
Be proud of you!

110
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,657
Get away!

111
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:55,174
- We have an exam tomorrow?
- Look at your calendar.

112
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,937
That's for your mother.

113
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:11,274
And that's for my pretty Sahar.

114
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,859
I miss her.

115
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,111
Rulers and ramen.

116
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:16,863
Thank you.

117
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,281
   everything.

118
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:58,404
What fuck, father of Assaad.

119
00:12:58,571 --> 00:13:00,990
Whenever it fills
the water reservoir,

120
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:04,452
we drown because of
his crappy piping!

121
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:09,165
This asshole thinks that
it's a gift ? This hole   rat?

122
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:12,460
Sahar!

123
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:15,129
It's not a house!

124
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,757
It's a shit barn!

125
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:21,636
Get out! You are going to be
Electrocute, mess!

126
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:25,181
- House of misfortune!
- Go live in the street.

127
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,600
There is plenty of room!

128
00:13:30,103 --> 00:13:35,149
Zain, why the vegetables
are rotten? Did you serve Assaad?

129
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,197
Zain, he gave you the liquorice
and the ramen?

130
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,462
It's not even day, fucking!
Lick me the bunch!

131
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,297
Stand up, bitch!

132
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:08,826
Juice juice,
you will not be disappointed!

133
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:38,940
Sahar, come here.

134
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:43,361
Why is there blood on your pants?

135
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,071
Where's the blood?

136
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:57,917
Go before we are seen.

137
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,880
Do you remember what happened?
Your girlfriend Alia?

138
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,508
When his mother found out,
she locked him up at home

139
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:08,970
until the day when a big pig
came to take it.

140
00:16:09,137 --> 00:16:11,806
Mom will want more of you.
She will throw you on the street.

141
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:15,101
- She'll give you   Assaad.
- But Assaad is really nice.

142
00:16:15,268 --> 00:16:16,352
He is a father!

143
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,480
He offers me ramen and liquorice.

144
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:21,482
He'll give you shit to eat!

145
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,902
They will give you   Assaad,
they will get rid of you.

146
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:26,946
We will never see you again.

147
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:31,617
And he will throw you with the rats,
he will shut you up, cover the windows ...

148
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,703
Will not let you out.

149
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,915
He will give you a drop of water
every 3 days and ramen p rim .

150
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,713
You did not see his ear?
A rat of l'gout bit him.

151
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,261
Here, put  a.

152
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:01,731
You've finished ?

153
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:03,024
Yes.

154
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:04,692
Here.

155
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,194
What do I do?

156
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,739
Put it like that,
down in your pants.

157
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,471
Your hair is very beautiful!
Who put you on?

158
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:34,805
Show me.

159
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:39,101
So, chief, are you finished?

160
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,730
I still have the cans to put away,
but my mother needs Sahar.

161
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,066
Stay again.
I'm happy to have your sister here.

162
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,609
I'll bring it to you later.

163
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:48,819
I'll talk to your mother.

164
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,156
Bye.

165
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:52,883
Attention, do not throw
the towels anywhere.

166
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,970
I'll tell you where to hide them.

167
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,058
- You got pig?
- Yes.

168
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,477
You do not throw them
in the trash.

169
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:17,116
Beet juice, we like serious!

170
00:19:17,575 --> 00:19:21,078
Tomato juice for the spleen!

171
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,582
It's   250.

172
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,001
Thanks bye.

173
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,919
Hold.

174
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,547
May God bless you.

175
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,637
Take two.

176
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,647
What do you want ?

177
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:51,359
- Just show you something.
- Leave me alone.

178
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,363
Come on, just a moment!

179
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,990
Fuck you, bastard.

180
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,659
Lick him, Zain.

181
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:02,661
Do not shit my dick!

182
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,877
Why enroll in school?

183
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,882
Out of the question. Forget and continue
   work at Assaad.

184
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,427
Why are you complicating things?

185
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,722
It's not better that he goes to learn
two or three words?

186
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,725
Go to your heart,
but do not wake her up.

187
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:26,727
Let him go to school.

188
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:32,358
They will send us something to eat
and get dressed, for kids ...

189
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,403
And what does Assaad say?

190
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,947
I'll talk to him.

191
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:40,825
In the morning, I will go to school,

192
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,702
and in the afternoon
I will work at home.

193
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,789
Look at Farid,
the neighbor's son, Zahra.

194
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:50,084
He returns from school
with all kinds of stuff.

195
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:52,837
They will give us mattresses,
clothes ...

196
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:53,629
Shut up !

197
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:57,883
At least he'll eat there and
bring food to his sisters.

198
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,720
They receive the remains of the hotels
and the most beautiful marriages.

199
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:05,766
Enjoy it a bit!
Why are you so?

200
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:07,810
Inch'Allah we will see Monday.

201
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:08,894
Inch'Allah?

202
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,813
Do you want me to swear on bread?

203
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,523
I said yes.

204
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,943
And if Assaad gets vexed
and puts us out?

205
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,279
Do not worry,
he will not get angry.

206
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:21,782
We will send him Zain after school
and he will do overtime.

207
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:42,261
Soap of my balls!

208
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,023
Why are you mouthing?

209
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:56,400
Dtends yourself.

210
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:01,697
Will deliver a gas cylinder
   Em Habib, at the end of the street.

211
00:22:38,484 --> 00:22:40,152
Ms. Bahia, I'm done.

212
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:42,321
- How much is it ?
- 13,000.

213
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:08,013
Do not touch me, fucked!

214
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:27,783
Where do these chickens come from?

215
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,827
Who brought them?

216
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,412
It's Assaad, he's at home.

217
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,415
Assaad is up there?

218
00:23:34,582 --> 00:23:35,499
Yes.

219
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:56,812
Mum ?

220
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,940
Assaad and his father do not care what here?

221
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:03,277
- Do not make a scene.
- Yeah, you'll see.

222
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:04,737
- What are they doing here?
- Calm down.

223
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,905
They discuss our rent
with your father.

224
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,782
I would put my hand to cut

225
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,868
they give you the hens
in exchange for Sahar.

226
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:12,411
Wait, listen to me ...

227
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,456
You're going to say this son of a bitch
that he did not do anything here.

228
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:18,208
- You do not understand ?
- Go tell him or I do it.

229
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,376
Lower your voice.

230
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,338
I swear by your sisters,
I swear by God.

231
00:24:22,504 --> 00:24:24,840
That there is nothing at all here.

232
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:29,970
- So why is Sahar made up?
- She imitates me to have fun.

233
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,222
As soon as they finish the juice,
I go outside.

234
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,017
Listen, do not make me
lose your head, OK?

235
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,186
Go tell him that's not going to work.

236
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,229
Go tell him or I do it.

237
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:41,565
I do not want to hear you.

238
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,692
Do you want him to throw us out?

239
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:45,069
Not a word.

240
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,738
Welcome, dear neighbors!

241
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,951
Abu Assaad, serve yourself.

242
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:54,578
Thank you.

243
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,330
Use yourself, Assaad.

244
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,292
Ch rie, take your heart
and go   c t .

245
00:25:09,468 --> 00:25:12,721
Removes me
this red lipstick.

246
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,974
You look like a witch
in this dress.

247
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:44,540
Sahar ...

248
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,041
Sahar!

249
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:49,086
Wakes up,
I'll take you somewhere.

250
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:52,256
- Where's that?
- I will tell you later. Arise.

251
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,759
Be ready when I come back.

252
00:27:55,926 --> 00:27:57,135
Do not say anything to anyone.

253
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:46,059
How much until Cola?

254
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:47,561
1,000.

255
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:54,318
And if I put my sister on my lap,
1,000 pounds will do the trick?

256
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,236
Where is your sister?

257
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:57,905
At home, I'll get her.

258
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:01,199
No problem,
go get her.

259
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,049
I do not want to leave, pity ...

260
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,635
I do not want to leave,
I beg you.

261
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,638
Mom, I do not want to leave!

262
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,515
I kill you if you dare
put your feet back here.

263
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,560
Where you take her,
asshole?

264
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,480
You want to do
the whore of this son of a bitch?

265
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:33,899
I want to stay with my brother.

266
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:35,400
That does not look at you.

267
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,528
- Mom, she's a child.
- Take off your onions.

268
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,322
Push yourself, I tell you.

269
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:41,865
Do not be fooled by this.

270
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,116
You, go down.

271
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,994
Zain, if you still try
something, I kill you.

272
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:47,996
I understood your little game, bastard.

273
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,832
You were going to fuck us
in shit, little junk.

274
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,670
You send it wipe
the shit of this pig!

275
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,546
Kiss my ass,
and you go down.

276
00:29:57,631 --> 00:29:58,507
You, go down.

277
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:00,258
Lick it!

278
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:02,386
She will not go to Assaad!

279
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,680
Little bastard!

280
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,139
Open the door, little asshole.

281
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,141
I do not want to leave, Mom!

282
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:09,726
I do not want !

283
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,436
Lick me!

284
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:14,815
I beg you, Mom,
I do not want to leave.

285
00:30:14,982 --> 00:30:16,358
Come on, Sahar!

286
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:18,443
It's enough!

287
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,781
You stay here, I tell you!

288
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,245
I want to stay here.
I beg you.

289
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:29,663
Come down.

290
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,873
Come down! Come down!

291
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:36,294
Mom, pity, I beg you!

292
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,170
Son of a bitch.

293
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,049
It's enough!
I can not stand this hell anymore.

294
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,301
I do not want to leave, Mom!

295
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,346
Stop!
Y tired of your bullshit!

296
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,059
Get her up, shit!

297
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:54,521
Another word
and I cut your tongue!

298
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:04,990
No !

299
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,167
Sahar!

300
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:18,336
Sahar!

301
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,672
Let her go !

302
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:30,098
You are happy ?

303
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:36,188
Do you play the little man?

304
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:40,692
You're going to pay him dear, rascal!

305
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:46,990
Let her go !

306
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:20,607
It was to remove him from his misery.

307
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,609
With me, she was dead.

308
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,779
She barely has a bed to sleep,

309
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:28,865
Barely enough to eat and drink.
She does not wash.

310
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,784
Never look at the TV.

311
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,913
I thought, "Marie-la, at least
she will sleep in a big bed. "

312
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,373
A real bed.

313
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,668
With a blanket.

314
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:41,461
She will be able to eat her hunger.

315
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:44,840
- You did not think to arrive there?
- Never.

316
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:48,009
I never wanted that!

317
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,976
You believe me proud that
my son stabbed someone?

318
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:58,937
Have you considered the possibility
that it is not our fault?

319
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:02,274
I am born like that. I was elevated
like  a. Where's my pch?

320
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,361
If I had the choice, I would be
maybe better than all of you!

321
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,656
- You can not say that.
- Please ...

322
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:13,160
Now, people are spitting on me
in the street.

323
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:16,163
They take me for an animal.

324
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,126
I never wanted everything.

325
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:24,254
I was told, "If you do not have children,
You are not a man."

326
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,174
"Your children will be
your vertebral column. "

327
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,677
But they broke the column,
they broke my heart.

328
00:33:30,844 --> 00:33:33,763
Cursed be the day
where I married.

329
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:37,100
Why I started
in this misery?

330
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:25,523
I'm not him, boy.

331
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,317
We have the same mouth, that's all.

332
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:37,202
But that must be a spider there,
not a cockroach.

333
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,536
Is not it ?

334
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:42,958
I do not need a spider,
I am Cafardman.

335
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,794
Why I need
of a spider?

336
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:49,756
That's it.
I am Cafardman.

337
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:54,219
What is your relationship?
with Spider-Man?

338
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,179
What is my link?

339
00:34:57,097 --> 00:34:58,556
I'm his cousin.

340
00:35:00,016 --> 00:35:01,726
So you are his cousin?

341
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:04,729
That's it. His cousin.

342
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,362
- What's your name ?
- Zain.

343
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,781
- Hussein?
- Zain!

344
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:15,699
Zain!

345
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,284
Where are you going, Zain?

346
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,035
At my grandmother's house.

347
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:21,454
- Speak louder.
- At my grandmother's house!

348
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,164
At your grandmother's house?

349
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:26,459
Well, she's lucky to have you.

350
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,837
Me, nobody cares for me.

351
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:32,132
- My life is...
- Please, the cigarette.

352
00:35:32,841 --> 00:35:34,259
Please.

353
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,890
Stop, sir.

354
00:35:41,057 --> 00:35:43,685
I'm going down here, please.

355
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,083
Wait, sir.

356
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,294
I'd like to get off here,
please.

357
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,298
Eat my ma ,s,
you will be my son-in-law ...

358
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,015
Mr. Cafardman?

359
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,532
The owner is there?

360
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,617
Sorry ?

361
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,327
The owner is there?

362
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,205
What do you want him?

363
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:38,002
I would like to ask him for work.

364
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,547
What kind of job?

365
00:39:41,714 --> 00:39:44,592
Whatever,
the important thing is that I work.

366
00:39:50,765 --> 00:39:51,975
What's your name ?

367
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:54,227
Zain.

368
00:39:55,019 --> 00:39:56,104
Zain?

369
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,022
And you ?

370
00:39:58,356 --> 00:39:59,983
My name is Tigest.

371
00:40:01,609 --> 00:40:06,573
I could clean the floor
or do the dishes, for example.

372
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,575
I really do not know.

373
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,372
Do you need an employee?

374
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:19,002
You need someone
to hold your fishing rod?

375
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,338
Where are your parents?

376
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:25,717
Where are they?

377
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:36,144
Sir, you would have a juice   250?

378
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:39,230
Or something else   250?

379
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,941
The juice is   1,000.

380
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:45,445
- You would not have something cheaper?
- No.

381
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,042
Go ahead.

382
00:40:59,792 --> 00:41:01,252
Take it, I tell you.

383
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,088
Do not worry, take it.

384
00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:41,876
It's busy, ma'am.

385
00:41:43,086 --> 00:41:43,961
There too?

386
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,172
Yes, and that one is out of order.

387
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,213
Tigest?

388
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:14,510
Tigest?

389
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:18,014
You have something to eat?

390
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,265
Please.

391
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:08,898
Zain.

392
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:34,066
Here's the milk, OK?

393
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:41,490
You give him one   11 am,
then another   14 h.

394
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:44,118
I come home at 3 pm

395
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,390
You do not go out of the house, okay?

396
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:11,854
Do not let Yonas cry,
the neighbor is very boring.

397
00:46:12,855 --> 00:46:16,317
Stay with your boyfriend.
I'm coming back, Yoni.

398
00:46:16,484 --> 00:46:19,362
<I> [Ethiopian]
This is your new friend, OK? </ I>

399
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:22,657
<i> Zain is your new friend. </ i>

400
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:27,536
<i> Are you sleepy? </ i>

401
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,014
<I> [Ethiopian]
Tell him you do not have the money. </ I>

402
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:33,728
<i> I told him, but he does not want to do
my papers for less than $ 1,500. </ i>

403
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,483
<i> I absolutely have to renew them,
they will expire. </ i>

404
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:44,155
<i> Do as you can,
but be quick. </ i>

405
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:49,827
<i> Lots of girls are arrested. </ i>

406
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:52,163
<i> Sometimes in the middle of the night. </ i>

407
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:01,255
You stink shit, shit!

408
00:48:10,765 --> 00:48:12,266
Stop!

409
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:16,771
Take a seat.

410
00:48:17,938 --> 00:48:19,231
Sit down, fuck!

411
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,501
It's fallen!

412
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:49,678
<i> Sleep, sleep ... </ i>

413
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:51,305
Come on, go to sleep.

414
00:48:53,474 --> 00:48:55,976
But what do you want from here?

415
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:04,819
<i> Sleep, Yonas my little brother ... </ i>

416
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:08,948
<i> Sleep, you'll have popo ... </ i>

417
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:42,064
Come eat corn, honey.

418
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:45,067
Bye, Harout.

419
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:49,113
Come in, enter!
Welcome!

420
00:49:51,407 --> 00:49:53,450
Hot, hot, hot!

421
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:32,823
Breath, breath.

422
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,870
Breath, Zain.

423
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:55,930
How old are you, Zain?

424
00:50:56,889 --> 00:50:58,432
I do not know.
12 years old, I think.

425
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:10,444
Do you have brothers and sisters?

426
00:51:10,903 --> 00:51:12,238
Full.

427
00:51:13,322 --> 00:51:15,866
- Do not they miss you?
- Yes.

428
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,453
The one I miss the most,
it's my sister, Sahar.

429
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:22,164
- Where is she?
- With her husband.

430
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:22,957
She's married?

431
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,501
Yes, and there was a drum
and a darbuka.

432
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:27,753
We had a party in the street.

433
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,838
People were licking
rice and flowers.

434
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,548
Congratulations.

435
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:42,768
Rahil Eresa.

436
00:51:42,935 --> 00:51:45,104
- Last name ?
- Shifaraw.

437
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:49,108
Do you know why you are in prison?

438
00:51:49,275 --> 00:51:50,567
Why are you handcuffed?

439
00:51:51,318 --> 00:51:53,696
- I do not have a residence permit.
- No papers.

440
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:55,864
Where were you working?

441
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,992
I worked for a lady
for 6 years.

442
00:51:58,158 --> 00:52:00,244
Then you ran away?

443
00:52:00,995 --> 00:52:02,538
She was not nice to you?

444
00:52:02,705 --> 00:52:03,914
She beat you?

445
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:08,502
No, she was very kind
but I fell in love,

446
00:52:08,669 --> 00:52:10,254
and I fell pregnant
and I left ...

447
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:11,297
What were you?

448
00:52:11,922 --> 00:52:14,591
I fell pregnant
and I left ...

449
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:16,260
Say, you speak Arabic well.

450
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:18,304
Do you understand everything I say?

451
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,597
- Yes I understand.
- So no need for translator?

452
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:21,557
No.

453
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:25,311
So you're gone
so that Madame does not know.

454
00:52:25,477 --> 00:52:29,815
I was afraid that the police
separates me from my son and expels me.

455
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:32,401
I was scared and
I did not say anything to anyone.

456
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,946
So, you left Yonas with Zain.

457
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:38,991
When you came home,
he had taken good care of him?

458
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:41,910
You never thought
that he could hurt her?

459
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:47,082
I was scared the first two days,

460
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:50,210
but after I started
Trust him.

461
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:52,838
You expected that
Zain do what he did?

462
00:52:53,005 --> 00:52:54,006
Never.

463
00:52:54,173 --> 00:52:57,009
They were like brothers.

464
00:52:57,176 --> 00:53:00,554
But I never wanted Zain

465
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:03,474
because I know Aspro.

466
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,184
Who is Aspro?

467
00:53:05,351 --> 00:53:07,895
The guy who falsified my license.

468
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:11,231
<i> Souk Al Ahad </ i>

469
00:53:20,491 --> 00:53:22,493
I gave you
until today, no?

470
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,037
But I talked to my girlfriend.

471
00:53:25,204 --> 00:53:29,124
We made him his papers for $ 900.

472
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:31,710
That your girlfriend
you make your papers then!

473
00:53:31,877 --> 00:53:35,339
No but why
this price difference?

474
00:53:35,506 --> 00:53:38,634
Stop your blah blah,
do not try to wind me up.

475
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,552
Calm down, that I can
place two words.

476
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:41,970
I'm trying to help you, there.

477
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,723
Who gave you the name of Tigest?
It's me.

478
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:48,811
Galope at your girlfriend
who can you do them   $ 900.

479
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:49,853
Do not do the malign.

480
00:53:50,396 --> 00:53:53,232
I beg you,
I could not find the $ 1,500.

481
00:53:53,399 --> 00:53:56,026
Look at that!
Does it look fake?

482
00:53:56,193 --> 00:53:57,945
Nobody will entangle you
with these papers.

483
00:53:58,112 --> 00:53:59,238
The woman on this paper ...

484
00:53:59,405 --> 00:54:00,030
BOOM!

485
00:54:00,197 --> 00:54:01,448
She exploded into a thousand pieces.

486
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:04,743
She had no one, no family.
Nobody has claimed his body.

487
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,246
You will be able to remove your grain of beauty,
Not needed anymore.

488
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:08,831
OK, but give me
a bit more time.

489
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:12,751
Ch'rie, I already told you that I can
save you $ 1 500.

490
00:54:12,918 --> 00:54:15,087
Give me Yonas and
you will have the license gratis.

491
00:54:15,254 --> 00:54:17,589
Never say again
the name of Yonas,

492
00:54:17,756 --> 00:54:19,967
it's impossible for me to do that!

493
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:23,137
Your kid lives like a fugitive
in this country.

494
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:26,807
The day they discover it,
they will expel you both.

495
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:29,768
You make him live underground
like a rat.

496
00:54:30,227 --> 00:54:33,647
He does not see the sun,
he will never go to school.

497
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:36,692
I suggest you give him a family.

498
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:37,943
You will be able to see him from time to time.

499
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,696
I know how to hide my son.

500
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:44,158
How to feed him and take care of him.

501
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:49,037
I will not stop telling you:
"Your son died before being born."

502
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:49,955
He does not exist.

503
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:53,500
Even a bottle of ketchup has a name.

504
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,670
With a production date
and forgiveness.

505
00:54:57,546 --> 00:55:00,257
I can not hear that anymore!

506
00:55:00,424 --> 00:55:02,468
How much do you miss?

507
00:55:02,634 --> 00:55:05,929
- $ 500.
- Are you missing $ 500?

508
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:08,474
I can buy a human being   500 $.

509
00:55:09,266 --> 00:55:11,768
So that you do not think
that Aspro is a crook,

510
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:15,105
I give you a reduction of $ 200.

511
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:16,899
And I give you 7 days.

512
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,776
Either you come here with the money,
or with your son,

513
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:23,739
either I never want to see
this pretty face here.

514
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:24,740
You understand ?

515
00:55:26,408 --> 00:55:30,329
So take your time,
all the time you want.

516
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:19,044
Viewing.

517
00:56:21,755 --> 00:56:24,758
<i> "Hello man.

I'm going to make him eat shit
if she continues to annoy you.

529
00:56:55,664 --> 00:56:57,332
I kill her or what?

530
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:01,587
What a shit, that bitch ...

531
00:57:02,296 --> 00:57:03,422
Slut, whore ...

532
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:04,923
Are you going to...

533
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:12,848
<i> [ thiopian] is enough,
it's up to you to recover my salary! </ i>

534
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:16,351
<i> You know the guy.
It was you who found me the job. </ I>

535
00:57:20,314 --> 00:57:23,191
<i> I'm not the owner,
I can not give you the money. </ i>

536
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:26,069
<i> If that's just me,
I would have given you the money. </ i>

537
00:57:26,236 --> 00:57:28,905
I am Tigest,
you know me ?

538
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:30,907
You know me ?

539
00:57:31,742 --> 00:57:34,578
Come back in the afternoon,
maybe the leader will be there.

540
00:57:48,383 --> 00:57:53,013
No, not in advance.
We are at the beginning of the month.

541
00:57:54,222 --> 00:57:57,559
You are illegal,
I already take a lot of risks.

542
00:57:58,143 --> 00:58:01,146
Please,
I will do what you want.

543
00:58:33,804 --> 00:58:35,389
Here is the identity card
of the boss.

544
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:39,476
I stole it for you. And you know
how much she trusts me

545
00:58:40,394 --> 00:58:42,688
It is not serious,
it's for the little one.

546
00:58:43,188 --> 00:58:45,315
You know what will happen to us
if they learn our story?

547
00:58:45,482 --> 00:58:47,109
They will expel you with the little one.

548
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,945
And God knows what they will do with me.

549
00:58:50,404 --> 00:58:52,406
I am only a simple guardian.

550
00:58:52,572 --> 00:58:54,074
They will replace me in the blink of an eye.

551
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:56,868
- You do not even want to see his picture?
- I can not.

552
00:58:57,035 --> 00:58:58,745
I beg you, leave.

553
00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:02,541
Before, I worked at a lady's house.

554
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:05,377
Then, I ran away.

555
00:59:06,086 --> 00:59:09,715
So, she has to pretend
for my old boss.

556
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:12,259
And to say that she does not want me anymore.

557
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:14,094
She does not want you anymore.

558
00:59:14,261 --> 00:59:17,097
She will say that she wants
transfer me to your home.

559
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:19,975
So you will become my new guarantor.

560
00:59:20,726 --> 00:59:21,893
My boss.

561
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:24,187
That's Jacqueline.

562
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:25,397
Who am I ?

563
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:27,065
I am not Jacqueline but Daad.

564
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:29,818
I'm going to play Jacqueline's role.

565
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:32,362
You have to work for me?

566
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:34,489
But I do not need an employee.

567
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:36,867
Oh my God,
I'm going to throw myself out of the window.

568
00:59:37,033 --> 00:59:40,996
But I can not pay a good one.

569
00:59:41,163 --> 00:59:44,916
I do not have $ 500 to hire him.

570
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,294
Do you see that cockroach?

571
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,087
He understood better.

572
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:51,757
If I ask him,
he can tell me the whole story.

573
00:59:57,512 --> 00:59:59,598
Like all Lebanese ...

574
00:59:59,765 --> 01:00:01,808
To resist and to transfer.

575
01:00:02,851 --> 01:00:04,269
Where do you live?

576
01:00:04,436 --> 01:00:05,645
Arax.

577
01:00:06,772 --> 01:00:08,023
Apartment?

578
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,900
Khachik Papikian.

579
01:00:10,233 --> 01:00:13,195
You give me fire, Mr. Harout?

580
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:18,116
Thank you.

581
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,785
Excuse me, are you smoking?

582
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:21,328
No thanks.

583
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:25,040
Why do not you want more
this girl?

584
01:00:25,457 --> 01:00:27,876
I have children in Canada,
may God bless them.

585
01:00:28,043 --> 01:00:30,504
They want to send me a Filipina.

586
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:31,880
They are better?

587
01:00:32,339 --> 01:00:35,217
- It's more prestigious.
- It's different.

588
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:38,678
And you, you agree
to work for him?

589
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:44,476
I want to sponsor this Filipina.

590
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:45,852
With all.

591
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:47,813
I want to help him.

592
01:00:47,979 --> 01:00:48,897
She is Ethiopian.

593
01:00:49,064 --> 01:00:51,233
I want to offer it as a gift
   my wife.

594
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:52,818
What is your business?

595
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:55,237
I have an electronics store.

596
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:57,864
Whose name is ?

597
01:00:58,031 --> 01:00:59,574
Haroutchum ...

598
01:00:59,741 --> 01:01:00,742
Electric.

599
01:01:01,409 --> 01:01:03,787
The address of your home
where the girl will reside.

600
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:05,997
Dawra, Bourj Hamoud.

601
01:01:06,498 --> 01:01:07,457
Your phone number?

602
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,835
09 ...

603
01:01:11,461 --> 01:01:14,172
4, 5, 6 ...
Something like this.

604
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:15,465
Something like that?

605
01:01:15,632 --> 01:01:17,342
This man is Armenian.

606
01:01:17,509 --> 01:01:20,053
You must not take it at your word.

607
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,848
Give me your correct number, 09 ...?

608
01:01:23,014 --> 01:01:25,016
- 3, 4 ...
- 3, 4 ...

609
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:26,977
- 5, 6 ...
- 5, 6 ...

610
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:28,520
And then 7?

611
01:01:29,229 --> 01:01:33,441
He pisses us off and then
he offers us a coffee?

612
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,362
Thank you,
we do not want your coffee.

613
01:01:37,696 --> 01:01:40,407
Thanks my God,
he did not call the cops.

614
01:01:40,574 --> 01:01:43,368
He calls the police!

615
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:46,580
<i> Yes, I am the king of Hachich ... </ i>

616
01:02:44,012 --> 01:02:45,430
What's the matter ?

617
01:02:45,764 --> 01:02:47,349
I look different?

618
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:09,889
Where are you going?

619
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:11,391
I'm going to call Mom.

620
01:04:11,558 --> 01:04:13,727
And then   <i> Souk El Ahad </ i>
to look for stuff.

621
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:18,231
<I> [Ethiopian]
You're not alone, Zain is here. </ I>

622
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:24,362
   everything '.

623
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:42,130
"All," Zain.

624
01:04:42,756 --> 01:04:43,965
Bye.

625
01:05:09,157 --> 01:05:12,702
<i> [ thiopian] I can not
send you money this month. </ i>

626
01:05:13,953 --> 01:05:18,291
<i> I'm taking English classes. </ i>

627
01:05:20,919 --> 01:05:22,712
<i> I'm sorry, Mom. </ i>

628
01:05:25,882 --> 01:05:28,968
<i> My boss is so nice to me. </ i>

629
01:05:31,096 --> 01:05:34,224
<i> I'm ashamed to ask him for money. </ i>

630
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:37,769
<i> I love you so much, Mom. </ i>

631
01:06:01,251 --> 01:06:02,168
Rahil?

632
01:06:05,213 --> 01:06:06,131
Rahil?

633
01:06:09,634 --> 01:06:10,760
Rahil?

634
01:07:03,646 --> 01:07:04,772
Manara?

635
01:07:04,939 --> 01:07:06,274
Yes, go up.

636
01:07:16,034 --> 01:07:17,952
I have not seen her since yesterday.

637
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:20,330
I thought she was sick.

638
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:24,375
She said she was going to the souk
and she did not come back.

639
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:26,920
She may have gone to Aspro.

640
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,422
Aspro? Who is Aspro?

641
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:33,176
It has a booth   <i> Souk Al Ahad. </ I>

642
01:07:51,027 --> 01:07:55,073
Pullovers   2 000 pounds!

643
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,200
Sir, where is the Aspro shop?

644
01:07:57,367 --> 01:07:59,494
Aspro? It's there.

645
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,830
The real Aspro?

646
01:08:07,669 --> 01:08:08,920
Rahil?

647
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:11,756
What is your connection with Rahil?

648
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:14,133
- We are parents.
- Are you parents?

649
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,510
Show me.

650
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:16,427
It's clear.

651
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:18,972
On the paternal or maternal side?

652
01:08:19,681 --> 01:08:21,641
This is his son Yonas?

653
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,268
Is not it ?

654
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:25,478
What is Yonas doing with you?

655
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:27,814
Rahil left yesterday.

656
01:08:28,356 --> 01:08:30,358
She has not come back since.

657
01:08:30,525 --> 01:08:32,694
Pass me Yonas.

658
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,238
- No no...
- Why are you scared?

659
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,199
It's my little Yonas!
I know everything about him.

660
01:08:39,284 --> 01:08:41,995
It's a little thug,
like his mother.

661
01:08:42,412 --> 01:08:46,624
Yasser, 2 falafels
for the two rabbits!

662
01:08:47,292 --> 01:08:48,835
You want to eat ?

663
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:53,214
You did not call her?

664
01:08:53,381 --> 01:08:55,008
I do not have a phone.

665
01:09:01,431 --> 01:09:03,141
His cell is off.

666
01:09:07,145 --> 01:09:09,439
Thank you, Yasser.

667
01:09:09,605 --> 01:09:12,233
- Come eat inside.
- No thanks.

668
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,027
What do I say to her, if she comes?

669
01:09:14,402 --> 01:09:16,654
Tell him we're waiting for him at home.

670
01:09:16,821 --> 01:09:18,698
- Stay here.
- No no.

671
01:09:18,865 --> 01:09:21,367
Wait here with me
in case it passes.

672
01:09:42,722 --> 01:09:43,765
Excuse me !

673
01:09:43,931 --> 01:09:45,767
Where can I open?

674
01:09:47,518 --> 01:09:48,978
Watch me  a.

675
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:01,199
- That's it.
- Thank you.

676
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:01,991
You're welcome.

677
01:10:07,997 --> 01:10:09,290
You are hungry ?

678
01:10:09,457 --> 01:10:10,166
No.

679
01:10:10,666 --> 01:10:11,667
Good app.

680
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:13,628
What's your name ?

681
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:15,129
Ibrahim.

682
01:10:16,214 --> 01:10:18,549
- And who is he ?
- His name is...

683
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:20,259
Assaad.

684
01:10:20,802 --> 01:10:22,887
- And you ?
- Maysoun.

685
01:10:23,846 --> 01:10:26,724
You stole it
or do you use it to beg?

686
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:28,518
It's my brother.

687
01:10:28,684 --> 01:10:30,186
He does not look like you.

688
01:10:30,353 --> 01:10:32,688
We are all black like him.

689
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,023
And...

690
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:36,651
over time, we have clarified.

691
01:10:38,236 --> 01:10:40,530
How much is the box?

692
01:10:40,905 --> 01:10:42,824
It depends on the car.

693
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:44,867
Let's say a woman passes ...

694
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:48,329
You look at his hand,
if she wears a ring ...

695
01:10:48,496 --> 01:10:51,332
You say, "May God protect you ...

696
01:10:51,499 --> 01:10:53,459
"and keep your husband."

697
01:10:53,626 --> 01:10:55,878
If she does not wear a ring,

698
01:10:56,045 --> 01:10:59,590
you say :
"May God send you a good husband."

699
01:11:00,133 --> 01:11:04,220
Stop licking your hands,
they are too dirty.

700
01:12:08,326 --> 01:12:11,287
Align, the Ethiopians ...

701
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:14,582
You are pregnant ?

702
01:12:18,127 --> 01:12:21,088
<I> [Ethiopian]
You can not say anything! </ I>

703
01:12:21,255 --> 01:12:23,174
<i> They'll take it from you. </ i>

704
01:12:44,946 --> 01:12:47,907
<I> [Ethiopian]
Yonas, my son, forgive me! </ I>

705
01:12:48,324 --> 01:12:50,826
<i> For God's sake, forgive me! </ i>

706
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:06,652
You would have something
   eat for a baby?

707
01:14:06,986 --> 01:14:07,903
Yes.

708
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:10,031
How many ?

709
01:14:10,615 --> 01:14:13,284
   250 books and   1 000 books.

710
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:15,453
I take that   250.

711
01:15:13,219 --> 01:15:14,345
Gote.

712
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,558
Just for this time.

713
01:16:48,856 --> 01:16:50,107
Without forgetting ...

714
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:53,152
It's not better
that a shawarma sandwich?

715
01:16:59,784 --> 01:17:02,536
Do not swallow it whole,
you will get sick!

716
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:05,748
H !

717
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:07,666
You swallowed it in full?

718
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:01,554
Its good ?

719
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:03,430
Savor, my great, savor.

720
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,127
No water ?

721
01:18:33,961 --> 01:18:36,672
I fuck this shitty country!

722
01:18:40,217 --> 01:18:42,219
She does not ask
news from his son?

723
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:45,139
Do not try to find out how he's doing.

724
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:48,517
In fact, your mother is worse than mine.

725
01:19:17,129 --> 01:19:19,131
After you, Mr. Yonas.

726
01:19:19,298 --> 01:19:20,549
Go ahead.

727
01:19:37,775 --> 01:19:38,734
Ibrahim!

728
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:41,403
Ibrahim!

729
01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:45,824
Ibrahim!

730
01:19:48,786 --> 01:19:50,329
What are you doing there?

731
01:19:50,496 --> 01:19:52,039
I sell these pans.

732
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:55,125
These shit pans?

733
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:59,171
It's no better than the rotten crown
What are you on your back?

734
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:01,048
It's for the graveyard, idiot!

735
01:20:01,215 --> 01:20:04,551
On the contrary,
I sell it in two seconds.

736
01:20:04,718 --> 01:20:06,011
They buy me everything.

737
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,472
You want to bet ?

738
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:10,724
We bet a food dish.

739
01:20:11,141 --> 01:20:14,979
I want meat rolls
and Chich Barak. And you ?

740
01:20:15,145 --> 01:20:18,857
I would die for a dish of
Chich Barak well hot ...

741
01:20:19,024 --> 01:20:20,359
My God...

742
01:20:20,526 --> 01:20:25,990
but not just
what a plate, a plate  norme ...

743
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:29,034
Where are you from
your food aid?

744
01:20:29,535 --> 01:20:32,329
You told me
food aid the other time.

745
01:20:32,496 --> 01:20:35,916
Ah, do you mean the clinic?

746
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:37,543
I can come with you ?

747
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,878
But no, you're Lebanese,
I am Syrian.

748
01:20:40,045 --> 01:20:41,964
Where did you find this rabbit?

749
01:20:42,131 --> 01:20:44,216
Melt up your onions.

750
01:20:46,135 --> 01:20:49,179
- Espèce of big goat.
- Let's go.

751
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:51,432
Can you move?

752
01:20:51,598 --> 01:20:54,893
- Or do you want to taste my fist?
- Come on, Ibrahim. Let's go.

753
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:59,690
In any case I leave you the country,
I'm breaking.

754
01:20:59,857 --> 01:21:00,774
Where?

755
01:21:00,941 --> 01:21:04,319
I leave you the business
and all the rest.

756
01:21:04,486 --> 01:21:05,654
All is for you.

757
01:21:05,821 --> 01:21:07,322
Where are you going?

758
01:21:07,489 --> 01:21:08,991
In Sweden.

759
01:21:09,366 --> 01:21:11,618
There is a neighborhood
full of Syrians there.

760
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:13,912
Nobody asks where you come from.

761
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:16,874
They do not harass you,
nothing at all.

762
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:19,043
I will have my own room.

763
01:21:19,209 --> 01:21:23,047
Nobody can enter without knocking.
I choose who can enter.

764
01:21:23,964 --> 01:21:27,509
In addition, children there
die of a natural death.

765
01:21:28,594 --> 01:21:29,803
I want to go with you.

766
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,306
Of course, but you need money.

767
01:21:32,473 --> 01:21:33,849
How many ?

768
01:21:34,016 --> 01:21:36,477
About $ 300. No more.

769
01:21:37,436 --> 01:21:39,021
That's a lot, $ 300.

770
01:21:39,188 --> 01:21:40,564
You know Os ...

771
01:21:40,731 --> 01:21:42,024
Ospar?

772
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:43,442
Aspro?

773
01:21:43,901 --> 01:21:45,152
Yes, in the souk.

774
01:21:45,319 --> 01:21:46,487
What does he have?

775
01:21:47,237 --> 01:21:48,781
This is his number.

776
01:21:50,074 --> 01:21:53,535
He's organizing the trip.
He gave me this paper.

777
01:21:54,578 --> 01:21:57,081
I drew a boat
Next to the number.

778
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:01,710
It's a boat
with pretty lights,

779
01:22:01,877 --> 01:22:03,003
good food.

780
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:05,005
Assaad can come too?

781
01:22:06,006 --> 01:22:07,841
He can swim ?

782
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:09,551
I will help him.

783
01:22:09,927 --> 01:22:13,055
I do not know.
You have to ask Ospro.

784
01:22:13,222 --> 01:22:15,099
Aspro, not Ospro.

785
01:22:16,225 --> 01:22:17,726
Aspro.

786
01:22:20,354 --> 01:22:22,231
"Where are you from?"

787
01:22:22,564 --> 01:22:23,857
<i> [Syrian accent]
"Where are you from?" </ I>

788
01:22:24,024 --> 01:22:26,485
<i> [Syrian accent]

789

01:22:28,570 --> 01:22:29,905
<I> "Aleppo." </ I>

791
01:22:30,697 --> 01:22:33,242
- "This is your brother?"

792
01:22:33,408 --> 01:22:35,661
<i> [Syrian accent]

793
01:22:37,496 --> 01:22:39,373
"What is his name ?"

794
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:41,250
<I> "Nawras." </ I>

795
01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:45,879
<i> "It's been two days
that he did not eat or drink anything. "</ i>

796
01:22:46,588 --> 01:22:48,132
"Why is he black like that?"

797
01:22:49,007 --> 01:22:53,137
<i> "My mother drank a lot of coffee
during her pregnancy. "</ i>

798
01:22:53,303 --> 01:22:56,265
<i> "She drank a coffee shop a day." </ i>

799
01:22:57,391 --> 01:22:59,226

<i> I lost it while walking
by the river. </ i>

801
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:07,317
You were strolling near the river?

802
01:23:07,484 --> 01:23:10,154
<i> Yes, and the papers
fell to the water. </ i>

803
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:13,157
<i> I could not catch them. </ i>

804
01:23:13,323 --> 01:23:14,867
How did you come here?

805
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:18,787
<i> We were at home, in Syria,
when our neighbor </ i>

806
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:21,665

<i> Rambo, the one who crawls. </ i>

812
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:33,051
Have you crawled?

813
01:23:33,218 --> 01:23:35,637
<i> Yeah, like him,
in the trenches. </ i>

814
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:38,557
Well, what do you want?

815
01:23:38,724 --> 01:23:42,769
<i> What you can, but the essential,
it's milk and diapers. </ i>

816
01:23:42,936 --> 01:23:44,438
Milk and diapers.

817
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:53,530
<i> And maybe ramen
and vinegar crisps? </ i>

818
01:23:58,535 --> 01:23:59,953
Arise.

819
01:24:02,414 --> 01:24:04,875
What are you looking at ?
Arise.

820
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:33,695
What Lamborghini!
Approach, small, that I see it.

821
01:24:34,655 --> 01:24:36,365
Rahil still has not
give sign of life?

822
01:24:36,531 --> 01:24:37,407
No...

823
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:39,743
I mean, yes! Rahil?

824
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,495
She came back
for a while !

825
01:24:41,662 --> 01:24:42,454
This is ...

826
01:24:42,621 --> 01:24:44,748
What is this thing
that you're trailing behind?

827
01:24:44,915 --> 01:24:47,251
It's a nuclear bomb
or a rocket?

828
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:49,711
A brand new water tank.

829
01:24:49,878 --> 01:24:53,006
How much do you want for
this "brand new" water tank?

830
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:55,342
- 20,000.
- 20,000?

831
01:24:57,386 --> 01:24:58,637
Yasser!

832
01:24:59,554 --> 01:25:02,557
Give this little 30,000 pounds
instead of 20.

833
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:04,977
Yonas ...

834
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:06,687
Why does Yonas look so skinny?

835
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:08,939
You do not eat?

836
01:25:09,398 --> 01:25:11,066
He looks sick.

837
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:15,028
My God, do you smell the dog or what?

838
01:25:16,571 --> 01:25:18,615
I've already talked to Rahil about it.

839
01:25:18,782 --> 01:25:22,035
I told him that a family
good people wants to take Yonas.

840
01:25:22,202 --> 01:25:23,954
They can take care of him,
dress ...

841
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:28,542
And you can put yourself $ 500
in the pocket.

842
01:25:29,084 --> 01:25:30,377
Where are you?

843
01:25:31,128 --> 01:25:31,753
So ?

844
01:25:32,296 --> 01:25:36,091
It looks like you can help people
   traveling in Turkey?

845
01:25:36,967 --> 01:25:38,468
Do you want to travel?

846
01:25:38,635 --> 01:25:39,970
I would very much like.

847
01:25:40,137 --> 01:25:41,680
Would you like to travel where?

848
01:25:41,847 --> 01:25:43,056
In Turkey.

849
01:25:43,223 --> 01:25:44,266
I mean in Sweden.

850
01:25:44,975 --> 01:25:48,812
- Turkey, Sweden, what you want.
- Which is prettier?

851
01:25:49,688 --> 01:25:52,065
You choose,
I can even send you to the moon.

852
01:25:52,232 --> 01:25:54,776
If you can convince Rahil
About the boy.

853
01:25:55,986 --> 01:25:57,654
Okay, little?

854
01:25:57,821 --> 01:25:59,197
That's it, boss.

855
01:26:01,450 --> 01:26:05,329
Take  a and say   Rahil
that Aspro greets him.

856
01:26:05,829 --> 01:26:06,580
Okay ?

857
01:26:07,581 --> 01:26:08,874
I'll ask Rahil.

858
01:26:09,041 --> 01:26:10,208
Yes, do it.

859
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,162
Yonas, give me the clothespin.

860
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:57,422
Do like me,
to warm your hands.

861
01:27:11,436 --> 01:27:15,607
My little sister washed the clothes
because my mother was sick.

862
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:19,069
So she washed the prescription
with clothes?

863
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,241
I give you a plate ...

864
01:27:25,075 --> 01:27:29,246
You'll have the rest when you pay me
the 3 000 that are missing.

865
01:27:29,413 --> 01:27:32,165
A plate?
Give me two.

866
01:27:57,524 --> 01:27:58,525
No.

867
01:28:08,743 --> 01:28:10,120
Go away !

868
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:13,457
I see you approaching,
I am not blind.

869
01:28:32,392 --> 01:28:35,353
Guys, are you coming to help me?

870
01:28:39,149 --> 01:28:42,027

Help me to wear this thing.

Go quickly !

876
01:28:58,335 --> 01:28:59,419

879
01:29:06,885 --> 01:29:08,553
- Free base?

880
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,681
It's Rivo, but in version jus.

881
01:29:15,185 --> 01:29:16,978
You sell us salty water,
little man ?

882
01:29:17,145 --> 01:29:19,147
Nothing better than seawater, man!

883
01:29:19,314 --> 01:29:20,899

Go, choose the country of your dreams.

886
01:29:44,756 --> 01:29:47,259
Let's go to Sweden, it's the most beautiful.

887
01:29:47,592 --> 01:29:49,928
We'll go with this imbecile Maysoun.

888
01:29:50,512 --> 01:29:52,264
In Sweden,

889
01:29:53,098 --> 01:29:55,809
no fake ass will come to you.

890
01:29:55,976 --> 01:30:00,272
You can even piss off the balcony,
nobody tells you anything!

891
01:30:09,281 --> 01:30:11,533
You pay what you owe him, bitch!

892
01:30:12,075 --> 01:30:14,160
Take your chick and break!

893
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:15,495
I'm leaving, asshole!

894
01:30:15,662 --> 01:30:18,832
Go and cook your ass.
When it is well cooked, eat it!

895
01:30:19,791 --> 01:30:21,293
Do not touch the little, big con.

896
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:23,545
D gage!

897
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,509
Go away !

898
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:33,054
D gage!

899
01:31:44,084 --> 01:31:46,628
You will break the door!
What are you doing ?

900
01:31:46,795 --> 01:31:51,007
Who is the son of a bitch who has changed
the lock and swing my stuff?

901
01:31:51,174 --> 01:31:54,219
They are your business.
Who are you ?

902
01:31:54,386 --> 01:31:55,970
I have things inside.

903
01:31:56,137 --> 01:31:57,931
Your stuff is at the owner's.

904
01:31:58,098 --> 01:31:59,808
Where's this shit owner?

905
01:31:59,974 --> 01:32:02,769
Go see where is hiding
your girlfriend slut.

906
01:32:02,936 --> 01:32:04,771
Otherwise, I call the owner.

907
01:32:04,938 --> 01:32:08,650
Tell him I kiss him very hard!

908
01:32:08,817 --> 01:32:11,528
Who are you compared to the other slut?

909
01:32:11,695 --> 01:32:12,570
I am his brother.

910
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:14,739
What shit bag are you coming out of?

911
01:32:14,906 --> 01:32:18,743
Unlock before I go crazy!

912
01:32:21,121 --> 01:32:22,914
I'll call the cops!

913
01:32:23,373 --> 01:32:24,541
You'll see !

914
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:30,380
If I do not break the door.
Where is the owner, brothel?

915
01:32:30,547 --> 01:32:34,509
If you do not mind,
I break you in two!

916
01:32:34,676 --> 01:32:37,512
- Shut up ! Shut up !
- D gage!

917
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:45,353
I. Want. My. Whore. Money !

918
01:33:36,988 --> 01:33:39,240
Stay here.
Not moving.

919
01:33:56,341 --> 01:33:57,759
Go back there!

920
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,456
Go.

921
01:34:29,374 --> 01:34:30,667
Go there!

922
01:34:30,834 --> 01:34:32,001
Go there!

923
01:34:44,597 --> 01:34:45,849
Go there.

924
01:36:37,502 --> 01:36:39,045
Yes my friend.

925
01:36:39,504 --> 01:36:40,463
costs ...

926
01:36:40,630 --> 01:36:43,341
I'm going to send you a little kid.

927
01:36:43,508 --> 01:36:47,136
He looks like a dog now,
make it a human being.

928
01:36:47,303 --> 01:36:50,056
OKAY ? I have to pass it.

929
01:36:50,223 --> 01:36:51,391
OK.

930
01:36:52,475 --> 01:36:53,184
Why are you sad ?

931
01:36:53,351 --> 01:36:54,644
It's nothing.

932
01:36:54,811 --> 01:36:56,437
It's good, we agreed.

933
01:36:56,604 --> 01:36:58,439
Do you have your papers?

934
01:36:58,982 --> 01:37:00,316
Identity card?

935
01:37:00,483 --> 01:37:01,734
I dunno.
At home, maybe.

936
01:37:02,235 --> 01:37:04,278
I need proof of your existence.

937
01:37:04,445 --> 01:37:06,572
An identity card,
an extract of a civil status,

938
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:08,950
a newspaper where there is your photo ...

939
01:37:09,117 --> 01:37:12,578
So that I can take you out
from the port of Beirut.

940
01:37:12,745 --> 01:37:13,955
Including ?

941
01:37:14,122 --> 01:37:15,748
No need to worry about Yonas.

942
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:18,334
I love it, and I will place it
in a family.

943
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:22,296
And the people with whom you travel
will take good care of you.

944
01:37:22,463 --> 01:37:26,259
You remember Yasser
who works for me? Go see it...

945
01:37:26,426 --> 01:37:28,261
He'll send you to the hairdresser.

946
01:37:28,428 --> 01:37:29,929
Then you go home
and what are you bringing back?

947
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:31,764
- Your papers.
- My papers.

948
01:37:31,931 --> 01:37:33,016
Okay ?

949
01:37:33,182 --> 01:37:36,394
Here are one, two, three, four ...

950
01:37:36,728 --> 01:37:38,021
Here.

951
01:37:38,187 --> 01:37:39,856
But you promised me $ 500.

952
01:37:40,023 --> 01:37:42,734
Do you intend to drink and eat for free?

953
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,528
That's $ 100 for your food.

954
01:37:46,487 --> 01:37:47,780
Kiss Me.

955
01:37:48,197 --> 01:37:51,159
Take care of yourself. Go ahead.

956
01:38:05,923 --> 01:38:08,342
It's good, you can go.

957
01:38:08,509 --> 01:38:11,471
I told you that
I will take care of him.

958
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:04,667
Zain!

959
01:40:06,294 --> 01:40:08,129
Have you been there since?

960
01:40:08,588 --> 01:40:10,173
That does not look at you.

961
01:40:10,756 --> 01:40:12,758
Where did you go?

962
01:40:12,925 --> 01:40:15,636
Where did you go?

963
01:40:15,970 --> 01:40:17,221
Where did you go?

964
01:40:17,388 --> 01:40:19,765
Where? Where? Where?

965
01:40:20,975 --> 01:40:22,435
I fuck you!

966
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,522
In any case, I did not come
to see you,

967
01:40:26,689 --> 01:40:28,691
nor to see that asshole there.

968
01:40:28,858 --> 01:40:32,278
- I want my papers.
- Yes ! Of course, my dear!

969
01:40:32,445 --> 01:40:36,574
Selim, do you know the best?
Your son wants his papers!

970
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:38,367
Where are my papers?

971
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,828
Where were you all this time?

972
01:40:40,995 --> 01:40:42,580
That does not look at you.

973
01:40:42,747 --> 01:40:44,248
Do not look at me?

974
01:40:44,832 --> 01:40:46,709
Why do you want your papers?

975
01:40:47,585 --> 01:40:49,128
Do you want to work as a smuggler?

976
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:52,840
My papers, my ID card,
no matter!

977
01:40:53,007 --> 01:40:57,178
Nobody has anything to wax
of you or us.

978
01:40:57,345 --> 01:41:01,682
Do not play the little man,
you little asshole!

979
01:41:02,308 --> 01:41:04,769
Come, you'll see,
I will give you your papers.

980
01:41:12,485 --> 01:41:15,988
I have all kinds of papers.
You just have to choose.

981
01:41:18,074 --> 01:41:20,701
I have papers
that will make me rot in jail.

982
01:41:22,495 --> 01:41:25,831
I have an eviction notice.

983
01:41:26,999 --> 01:41:28,918
And that's the paper
Most important.

984
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:33,005
Come.
Look at this paper!

985
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:38,719
It is a hospital sheet
who wants the heart.

986
01:41:39,637 --> 01:41:42,598
We are less than nothing, my boy.

987
01:41:42,765 --> 01:41:44,475
Parasites.

988
01:41:44,642 --> 01:41:48,437
You just have to live without paper ...

989
01:41:48,604 --> 01:41:52,191
If not, I'll swing you through the window
and I'm done with it.

990
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:54,026
You got pig?

991
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:58,489
Leave or I break your mouth.

992
01:41:59,282 --> 01:42:00,074
Lick it, Selim!

993
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:05,788
Go tell the one who sends you that
I never made you papers!

994
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:08,958
Return from where you come from!

995
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:12,295
I fuck you and I curse
the day you are born!

996
01:42:12,461 --> 01:42:14,505
Who is in the hospital?

997
01:42:17,550 --> 01:42:20,386
Not a word Selim,
do not say another word!

998
01:42:20,761 --> 01:42:22,888
Who went back to the hospital?

999
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:26,642
Who went back to the hospital?

1000
01:42:26,809 --> 01:42:28,477
Who is in the hospital?

1001
01:42:29,270 --> 01:42:32,231
Send him home or I kill him!

1002
01:42:35,484 --> 01:42:38,279
- You junk!
- Who was at the hospital?

1003
01:42:39,822 --> 01:42:42,950
- Emmerner!
- Who went back to the hospital?

1004
01:42:43,868 --> 01:42:44,660
Talk to me.

1005
01:42:44,827 --> 01:42:46,829
Who was at the hospital?

1006
01:42:55,588 --> 01:42:58,841
What did he do to him,
this son of a bitch?

1007
01:42:59,425 --> 01:43:01,177
What did he do to him?

1008
01:43:01,844 --> 01:43:03,888
What did he do to him?

1009
01:43:04,513 --> 01:43:06,849
Sahar is gone.
It's finish.

1010
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:10,770
She left ?

1011
01:43:11,645 --> 01:43:14,315
She left ?
You will see what it is, to leave.

1012
01:43:17,151 --> 01:43:19,612
I will show you who is what.

1013
01:43:19,779 --> 01:43:22,782
- Come back here, little asshole!
- He has a knife!

1014
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:25,868
I'll fuck you,
if you do not come back!

1015
01:43:26,035 --> 01:43:28,120
Come back, doggie!

1016
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:31,332
I will kill you with your bare hands!

1017
01:44:16,502 --> 01:44:18,212
Take off the handcuffs.

1018
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:24,111
You are the husband of ...

1019
01:45:24,278 --> 01:45:26,113
- Sahar.
- Sahar.

1020
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:27,948
She was old,
when did you pass it?

1021
01:45:28,115 --> 01:45:30,284
- 11 years old
- 11 years old?

1022
01:45:32,703 --> 01:45:35,414
A girl of 11 years
is able to marry?

1023
01:45:35,581 --> 01:45:37,124
She knows what marriage is?

1024
01:45:38,834 --> 01:45:40,920
From what I know ...

1025
01:45:41,837 --> 01:45:43,964
Yes, she can.

1026
01:45:44,131 --> 01:45:46,592
I mean she was "mother" already.

1027
01:45:46,759 --> 01:45:47,384
Really ?

1028
01:45:47,551 --> 01:45:51,096
I did not know she was a tomato
or a potato to be mother!

1029
01:45:51,263 --> 01:45:53,682
Zain, calm down!

1030
01:45:54,642 --> 01:45:59,688
I did not know
that she could die of it.

1031
01:45:59,855 --> 01:46:04,026
Lots of girls in the neighborhood
get married at this age.

1032
01:46:04,193 --> 01:46:08,405
Even my mother-in-law
was married very young.

1033
01:46:08,572 --> 01:46:11,200
And here, alive.

1034
01:46:12,326 --> 01:46:15,704
after how long
did she become pregnant?

1035
01:46:15,871 --> 01:46:17,665
2 or 3 months later.

1036
01:46:17,831 --> 01:46:19,667
All was normal?

1037
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:22,253
At the beginning,
I did not notice anything abnormal.

1038
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:23,671
Then she blew.

1039
01:46:23,837 --> 01:46:25,756
She blew a lot.

1040
01:46:26,882 --> 01:46:29,260
And what happened after?

1041
01:46:29,718 --> 01:46:32,805
He was rushed to the hospital,
with his parents.

1042
01:46:32,972 --> 01:46:35,641
She is deceased
At the hospital gate.

1043
01:46:35,808 --> 01:46:38,310
We did not manage to get her admitted.

1044
01:46:42,856 --> 01:46:46,068
Can I know why
they refused to admit it?

1045
01:46:46,485 --> 01:46:48,904
Because she has no papers.

1046
01:46:49,363 --> 01:46:53,158
Master, that's enough.
You bombard her with questions.

1047
01:46:53,659 --> 01:46:57,454
I made the slave all my life
and you dare to judge me?

1048
01:46:57,621 --> 01:47:00,958
By what right do you dare to judge me?
Have you been in my skin?

1049
01:47:01,125 --> 01:47:02,418
Did you live what I lived?

1050
01:47:02,585 --> 01:47:05,087
No never,
and you will never live it!

1051
01:47:05,254 --> 01:47:07,464
Not even in your worst nightmares.

1052
01:47:07,631 --> 01:47:09,675
In my place,
you would have hanged yourself!

1053
01:47:10,926 --> 01:47:14,221
You imagine having to feed your children
   water and sugar,

1054
01:47:14,388 --> 01:47:16,932
because you do not have
nothing else to give them.

1055
01:47:17,099 --> 01:47:20,185
I am ready to commit 100 crimes
to keep my kids alive!

1056
01:47:20,352 --> 01:47:21,729
These are my children.

1057
01:47:21,895 --> 01:47:25,190
Nobody has the right to judge me.
I am my own judge.

1058
01:47:25,357 --> 01:47:27,276
The flesh of my flesh!

1059
01:47:28,027 --> 01:47:29,695
You hear me ?

1060
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:44,001
The Syrian, Hussein ...

1061
01:47:44,918 --> 01:47:46,795
The Egyptian, Mohammad ...

1062
01:48:01,727 --> 01:48:04,188
You can lend us
the ear a little?

1063
01:48:04,355 --> 01:48:07,650
We are there, with the priest,
to meet you

1064
01:48:08,233 --> 01:48:13,572
Have a good time with you.

1065
01:48:13,906 --> 01:48:16,950
You cheer up a bit.

1066
01:48:17,117 --> 01:48:19,620
Come on, let's sing a song.

1067
01:50:00,095 --> 01:50:06,685
<i> Zain Al Hajj, take your stuff
and go to the office. </ i>

1068
01:50:23,952 --> 01:50:24,953
Zain?

1069
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:25,788
Zain?

1070
01:50:26,663 --> 01:50:27,706
Zain?

1071
01:50:27,873 --> 01:50:28,665
Zain!

1072
01:50:30,334 --> 01:50:31,251
Zain!

1073
01:50:31,418 --> 01:50:33,587
What are you doing there?

1074
01:50:34,338 --> 01:50:35,923
Zain, where is Yonas?

1075
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,091
Zain!

1076
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,969
Zain, where is Yonas?

1077
01:50:42,054 --> 01:50:43,180
Zain!

1078
01:50:43,347 --> 01:50:44,640
Where is my son?

1079
01:50:44,807 --> 01:50:47,392
Where is Yonas? Where?

1080
01:50:48,769 --> 01:50:51,480
What did you confide in?

1081
01:50:54,942 --> 01:50:57,528
My son is alone!

1082
01:51:01,907 --> 01:51:03,367
His eye ...

1083
01:51:03,534 --> 01:51:04,701
from this side,

1084
01:51:04,868 --> 01:51:06,662
is blue, blue, blue.

1085
01:51:08,247 --> 01:51:13,335
- His two eyes are blue?
- No. This eye is brown.

1086
01:51:13,502 --> 01:51:15,671
And this eye is blue.

1087
01:51:36,817 --> 01:51:39,111
<i> You are live
on </ i> Libert  Always.

1088
01:51:39,278 --> 01:51:41,780
<i> Please go down
the volume of your task. </ i>

1089
01:51:43,115 --> 01:51:47,744
<i> It's been a while since
I am your broadcast ... </ i>

1090
01:51:47,911 --> 01:51:53,166
<i> and I know that you always approach
social problems ... </ i>

1091
01:52:27,284 --> 01:52:28,452
How's it going?

1092
01:52:35,918 --> 01:52:37,544
You're sick ?
Did you catch cold?

1093
01:52:38,211 --> 01:52:41,048
Congratulations, are you no longer in mourning?

1094
01:52:41,548 --> 01:52:43,634
Do not you wear black anymore?

1095
01:52:48,472 --> 01:52:51,433
I brought you sweets
to nibble.

1096
01:52:52,601 --> 01:52:54,227
Eat them, Zain.

1097
01:52:56,313 --> 01:53:00,150
Why do you want me so much?

1098
01:53:00,567 --> 01:53:03,111
I can do nothing.
I could not do anything.

1099
01:53:03,904 --> 01:53:06,573
It's my daughter,
my misfortune to me.

1100
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:08,700
Why are you here?

1101
01:53:12,788 --> 01:53:14,706
When God takes you something,

1102
01:53:14,873 --> 01:53:17,584
He offers you something in return.

1103
01:53:19,169 --> 01:53:21,296
What did he offer you, God?

1104
01:53:24,758 --> 01:53:26,385
I am pregnant.

1105
01:53:27,886 --> 01:53:30,430
You're going to have a brother or a sister.

1106
01:53:32,808 --> 01:53:34,101
My heart hurts

1107
01:53:34,267 --> 01:53:38,021
I hope it's a girl.
It will be called Sahar.

1108
01:53:38,188 --> 01:53:40,941
Your words pierce my heart.

1109
01:53:41,108 --> 01:53:46,697
When you get out of here, she'll be
walking, playing ...

1110
01:53:47,072 --> 01:53:49,741
I do not want to see you here anymore.

1111
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:52,828
You are without heart.

1112
01:53:56,832 --> 01:53:59,918
Leave me alone, I want to go out.

1113
01:54:06,466 --> 01:54:10,846
<i> Since the death of my father,
I did not smile ... </ i>

1114
01:54:13,223 --> 01:54:17,060
<i> This report on injustices
against children </ i>

<i> Is there an adult
Next to you, Zain? </ I>

1119
01:54:42,669 --> 01:54:43,962
An officer.

1120
01:54:44,838 --> 01:54:46,339
<i> An officer? </ i>

1121
01:54:46,673 --> 01:54:49,259
<i> Where are you calling us, Zain? </ i>

1122
01:54:49,426 --> 01:54:50,802
<i> From the prison. </ i>

1123
01:54:51,219 --> 01:54:52,387
I hear Zain's voice.

1124
01:54:52,554 --> 01:54:53,972
<i> From prison? </ i>

1125
01:54:55,515 --> 01:54:56,725
<i> What prison? </ i>

1126
01:54:56,892 --> 01:54:58,351
It's him !

1127
01:54:58,518 --> 01:55:00,854
<i> Roumieh Prison for Minors. </ i>

1128
01:55:02,898 --> 01:55:06,943
<i> Zain, why are you calling us?
What can I do for you? </ I>

1129
01:55:09,446 --> 01:55:12,115
<i> I want to complain
against my parents. </ i>

1130
01:55:14,785 --> 01:55:15,786
The boys!

1131
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:18,205
Zain is on the spot!

1132
01:55:33,345 --> 01:55:36,389
<i> Zain, you're live.
What would you like to say? </ I>

1133
01:55:39,059 --> 01:55:42,020
<i> I want adults to listen to me. </ i>

1134
01:55:42,187 --> 01:55:46,483
<i> I want incapable adults

1135
01:55:47,234 --> 01:55:49,236
<i> What am I going to remember? </ i>

1136
01:55:49,402 --> 01:55:53,198
<i> Of violence,
insults or beatings, </ i>

1137
01:55:53,365 --> 01:55:56,201
<i> of the chain, the pipe
or belt? </ i>

1138
01:55:57,035 --> 01:56:00,413
<i> The sweetest word I'm told,
it is: "D gage, son of a bitch!" </ i>

1139
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:02,624
<i> "Break up, junk!" </ i>

1140
01:56:04,835 --> 01:56:07,087
<i> Life is a big shit. </ i>

1141
01:56:07,462 --> 01:56:09,756
<i> It's not worth more than my shoe. </ i>

1142
01:56:13,426 --> 01:56:15,679
<i> I live in hell here. </ i>

1143
01:56:16,138 --> 01:56:19,015
<i> I burn like cremated meat. </ i>

1144
01:56:19,349 --> 01:56:20,767
How's it going?

1145
01:56:23,854 --> 01:56:25,814
<i> Life is a dog. </ i>

1146
01:56:27,399 --> 01:56:32,195

1148
01:56:37,576 --> 01:56:39,953
<i> But God does not want
that's happening to us. </ i>

1149
01:56:41,872 --> 01:56:45,625
<i> He prefers to keep mops
for others. </ i>

1150
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:54,509
This child that you wear
will be like me.

1151
01:57:00,223 --> 01:57:02,809
Zain, what do you want from your parents?

1152
01:57:03,685 --> 01:57:06,313
I want them to have no more children.

1153
01:57:06,771 --> 01:57:07,647
Stronger.

1154
01:57:07,814 --> 01:57:10,442
I want them to have no more children.

1155
01:57:10,609 --> 01:57:11,943
You want them to have no more children.

1156
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:13,028
Yes.

1157
01:57:14,696 --> 01:57:17,365
I do not think they will do
still children.

1158
01:57:17,532 --> 01:57:19,326
And who is in his belly?

1159
01:57:23,288 --> 01:57:25,207
He will come to the world, right?

1160
01:57:53,985 --> 01:57:59,407
<i> We found a deposit in which
Were sequestr es 15 people ... </ i>

1161
01:59:32,834 --> 01:59:34,044
Stand on the line.

1162
01:59:37,297 --> 01:59:39,132
A little to the right.

1163
01:59:39,507 --> 01:59:41,092
No,   left.

1164
01:59:41,634 --> 01:59:43,136
Rather   right.

1165
01:59:45,847 --> 01:59:47,223
But that's my right.

1166
01:59:47,390 --> 01:59:49,059
And that's my left.

1167
01:59:52,103 --> 01:59:53,855
Lift the chin.

1168
01:59:55,523 --> 01:59:57,650
Look in front.

1169
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:00,236
Mouse.

1170
02:00:02,197 --> 02:00:03,073
Mouse, Zain.

1171
02:00:03,239 --> 02:00:06,493
It's a passport photo,
not a death certificate!
